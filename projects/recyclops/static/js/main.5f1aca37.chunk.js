Despite consumers\u2019 best intentions to responsibly dispose waste, recycling contamination and incorrect disposal of trash continue to present an obstacle to achieving this goal. Recycling contamination is when non-recyclable material or contaminants ends up in the recycling system which can force entire streams of perfectly recyclable material to go to landfills.

Additionally, recycling contamination can expose workers in recycling facilities to hazardous waste, vector-borne diseases and physical injuries. Recycling contamination also causes devaluation of recyclable material, which increases costs of services and even forces some recycling plants to close down; every percent decrease in contamination lowers recycling costs in Toronto by $1 million dollars per year.
